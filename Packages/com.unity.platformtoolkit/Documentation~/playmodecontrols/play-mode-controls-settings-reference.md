### Saves

Use the following options to import and update local save data using Play Mode Controls.

> [!NOTE]
> The following options are supported only when the selected **Behavior** supports local saving. For example, **Generic Local Saving**.

| Property | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Import** | Use the **Import** option to import local save data. Save data must be in a `.zip` archive format. If a save of the same name already exists, it will be overwritten. |
| **Export** | Export the save data to a local archive file. |
| **Delete** | Delete the imported save data. |

> [!NOTE]
>  When you import a save archive on macOS, ensure the archive doesn't contain meta files, such as those in the `__MACOSX` folder, as these will cause the import to fail. To create a valid archive for import, run the `zip -r <filename>.zip .` command in the terminal, replacing `<filename>` with your desired archive name.
