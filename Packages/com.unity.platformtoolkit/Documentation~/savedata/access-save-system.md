# Access a save system

The Platform Toolkit package can help manage save files when accessing an available save system. Save systems are available from user accounts on most common platforms.

## Access a platform-specific save system

Use the following example to access a platform save system that's connected to a system-level user account:

```csharp
ISavingSystem savingSystem;

if (PlatformToolkit.Capabilities.AccountSaving)
{
   try
   {
       savingSystem = await account.GetSavingSystem();
   }
   catch (InvalidAccountException e)
   {
       // Handle signed out account
   }
}
else if (PlatformToolkit.Capabilities.LocalSaving)
{
   savingSystem = PlatformToolkit.LocalSaving;
}
```

For more information, refer to the [GetSavingSystem](xref:Unity.PlatformToolkit.IAccount.GetSavingSystem) API reference.

## Access a local save system

If your target platform doesn't have system-level user accounts, use the local saving system.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all platforms support a local saving system. Check the capabilities of your target platform service to ensure you use the most appropriate system for your application.

```csharp
var savingSystem = PlatformToolkit.LocalSaving;
```

Use the local saving system for platforms that don't support accounts, or for platforms where a user can decline to sign in but still continue to play the game.

When developing for mobile platforms, you can use the local saving system when a user declines to sign into an account and then migrate the data later to an account saving system. Both local and account-based saving systems are accessible at the same time on mobile platforms.

For more information, refer to the [LocalSaving](xref:Unity.PlatformToolkit.PlatformToolkit.LocalSaving) scripting API reference.
