    /// <remarks>
    /// ### Systems in ECS
    ///
    /// A typical system operates on a set of entities that have specific components. The system identifies
    /// the components of interest, reading and writing data, and performing other entity operations as appropriate.
    ///
    /// The following example shows a basic system that schedules an [IJobEntity] job to iterate over entities.
    /// In this example, the system iterates over all entities with both a Position and a Velocity component and
    /// updates Position based on the delta time elapsed since the last frame.
    ///
    /// <example>
    /// <code source="../DocCodeSamples.Tests/SystemBaseExamples.cs" region="basic-system" title="Basic System Example" language="csharp"/>
    /// </example>
    ///
    /// #### System lifecycle callbacks
    ///
    /// You can define a set of system lifecycle event functions when you implement a system. The runtime invokes these
    /// functions in the following order:
    ///
    /// * <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.OnCreate"/> -- called when the system is created.
    /// * <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.OnStartRunning"/> -- before the first OnUpdate and whenever the system resumes
    ///   running.
    /// * <see cref="OnUpdate"/> -- every frame as long as the system has work to do (see
    ///   <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.ShouldRunSystem"/>) and the system is <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.Enabled"/>.
    /// * <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.OnStopRunning"/> -- whenever the system stops updating because it finds no
    ///   entities matching its queries. Also called before OnDestroy.
    /// * <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.OnDestroy"/> -- when the system is destroyed.
    ///
    /// All of these functions are executed on the main thread. To perform work on background threads, you can schedule
    /// jobs from the <see cref="SystemBase.OnUpdate"/> function.
    ///
    /// #### System update order
    ///
    /// The runtime executes systems in the order determined by their <see cref="ComponentSystemGroup"/>. Place a system
    /// in a group using <see cref="UpdateInGroupAttribute"/>. Use <see cref="UpdateBeforeAttribute"/> and
    /// <see cref="UpdateAfterAttribute"/> to specify the execution order within a group.
    ///
    /// If you do not explicitly place a system in a specific group, the runtime places it in the default <see cref="World"/>
    /// <see cref="SimulationSystemGroup"/>. By default, all systems are discovered, instantiated, and added to the
    /// default World. You can use the <see cref="DisableAutoCreationAttribute"/> to prevent a system from being
    /// created automatically.
    ///
    /// #### Entity queries
    ///
    /// A system caches all queries created through iteration constructs (such as an [IJobEntity] schedule or a
    /// <see cref="SystemAPI.Query{T}"/> loop), through <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.GetEntityQuery"/>, or through
    /// <see cref="ComponentSystemBase.RequireForUpdate"/>. By default, a system calls `OnUpdate()` every frame. You can use
    /// the <see cref="RequireMatchingQueriesForUpdateAttribute"/> to make the system only update when one of these cached
    /// queries finds entities. See <see cref="M:Unity.Entities.ComponentSystemBase.ShouldRunSystem"/> for more details on whether
    /// a system will update.
    ///
    /// #### Entity iteration options
    ///
    /// * **[IJobEntity]** — define a struct with an Execute method taking `ref` / `in` component parameters. Run it using
    ///   `Schedule()`, `ScheduleParallel()`, or `Run()`. Jobs execute asynchronously, and cannot safely access data
    /// outside of their own instance. Put any required data into fields and set
    ///   them when you create the job (for example, `new MyJob { DeltaTime = SystemAPI.Time.DeltaTime }`).
    /// * **<see cref="SystemAPI.Query{T}"/>** — iterate immediately on the main thread (optionally Burst compiled) using
    /// `foreach` over tuples of `RefRO<T>` / `RefRW<T>` wrappers.
    /// * **<see cref="IJobChunk"/>** — implement job structs that run per chunk.
    /// * **C# Jobs (<see cref="IJob"/>, <see cref="IJobParallelFor"/>, etc.)** — general-purpose, non-ECS-specific jobs.
    ///   Use such jobs for computation or processing that does not require an entity query.
    ///
    /// #### System attributes
    ///
    /// You can use a number of attributes on your SystemBase implementation to control when it updates:
    ///
    /// * <seealso cref="UpdateInGroupAttribute"/> -- place the system in a <seealso cref="ComponentSystemGroup"/>.
    /// * <seealso cref="UpdateBeforeAttribute"/> -- always update the system before another system in the same group.
    /// * <seealso cref="UpdateAfterAttribute"/> -- always update the system after another system in the same group.
    /// * <seealso cref="RequireMatchingQueriesForUpdateAttribute"/> -- skip `OnUpdate` if every EntityQuery used by
    ///   the system is empty.
    /// * <seealso cref="DisableAutoCreationAttribute"/> -- do not create the system automatically.
    /// * <seealso cref="AlwaysSynchronizeSystemAttribute"/> -- force a [sync point](xref:concepts-structural-changes) before invoking
    ///   `OnUpdate`.
    ///
    /// Migration note: `Entities.ForEach` and `Job.WithCode` are deprecated as of Entities 1.4. Use [IJobEntity], [IJobChunk] or
    /// <see cref="SystemAPI.Query{T}"/>. For more information, refer to the upgrade guide.

        /// dependencies when scheduling it. The system also combines the new job's <see cref="JobHandle"/> with Dependency so that any subsequent
        /// job scheduled in the system depends on the earlier jobs (in sequence).
        ///
        /// The following example illustrates an `OnUpdate()` implementation that relies on implicit dependency

        /// an IJobEntity. When you pass in a handle, the scheduling API returns a new handle representing the input dependencies
        /// combined with the new job. Handles from jobs scheduled with explicit dependencies are not automatically combined with
        /// the system’s Dependency property. You must set the Dependency property manually to propagate dependencies.
        ///
        /// The following <see cref="OnUpdate"/> function illustrates manual dependency management. The function schedules
        /// two IJobEntity jobs that do not depend upon each other (only the incoming system Dependency). Then a third job
        /// (IJobEntity or an <see cref="IJob"/>) depends on both of the prior jobs; their handles are combined using
