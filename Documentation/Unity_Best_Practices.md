# Introduction

## Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.

### – Michael Feathers, author of Working Effectively with Legacy Code

Most game developers would agree that you need clean code: Code that is easy to read and efficient to maintain and reuse. Once your logic is functional, then the process of refactoring and cleaning up begins.

There are good reasons for this congruence. Something that might be obvious to you as the original author might be less apparent to another developer. By the same token, when you implement some logic now, you might not remember what that same code snippet does three months later.

Chances are you already have preferences for how to write your code today. However, your teammates of tomorrow will most likely have different preferences. While there is no right solution this guide provides some tips on how you can leverage a style guide to agree on standards.

This guide compiles advice from industry experts on how to use or adapt existing industry 
standard code style guides. Establishing such a guide for everyone in your team to follow will 
help ensure your codebase can grow your project to a commercial-scale production.

These tips and tricks will help your development process in the long term, even if they cost 
you extra effort up front. A cleaner, more scalable codebase also facilitates the efficient 
onboarding of new developers as you expand your team.

Keep your code clean to make life easier for yourself and everyone involved in the project.

Clean code aims to make development more scalable and conform to a set of production 
standards, including:

— Follow consistent naming conventions

— Format your code for legibility

— Organize classes and methods to keep them small and readable

— Comment on any code that isn’t self-explanatory

Whether you’re building a puzzler for mobile or a massive MMORPG targeted at consoles, 
keeping your codebase clean reduces the total cost of software maintenance. You can then 
implement new features or patch your existing software more easily.

**Note: This is the second edition of this e-book, now updated for Unity 6.**

## Developing as a team [Image: Im0]

## Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. [Image: Im0]

## – Martin Fowler, author of Refactoring [Image: Im0]

## KISS (keep it simple, stupid)

Let’s face it: Engineers and developers can overcomplicate things, even though computing and

finding the simplest solution to the problem at hand.

No developer is an island. As the technical needs of your game application grow, you’ll need 
help. Inevitably, you’ll add more team members with diverse skill sets. Clean code introduces 
coding standards for your ever-expanding team so everyone is on the same page. Now 
everybody can work on the same project with a more uniform set of guidelines.

Before looking into the specifics of code style guides, let’s revisit some general, style-agnostic 
rules to help you scale up your Unity development.

---

There’s no need to reinvent the wheel if a proven and simple technique solves your challenge. 
Unity already includes numerous solutions in its Scripting API. For example, if the existing 
Hexagonal Tilemap works for your strategy game, or the UnityEngine.Pool solves your object 
pooling system needs, skip writing your own. The best code you can write is no code at all.

## The KISS principle

The well-known KISS principle emphasizes simplicity in design, an idea that’s been 
popular throughout different times, as these quotes attest:

“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” 
– Leonardo da Vinci

“Make simple tasks simple!” 
– Bjarne Stroustrup

“Simplicity is a prerequisite for reliability.” 
– Edsger W. Dijkstra

“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.”
– Albert Einstein

In programming, that means keeping your code as streamlined as possible. Avoid adding 
unnecessary complexity

## The YAGNI principle

The related YAGNI principle (“you aren’t gonna need it”) instructs you to implement 
features only as you need them. Don’t worry about features that you might need once the 
stars align. Build the simplest thing that you need now and build it to work.

## Don’t code around the problem

The first step of software development is to understand what you are trying to solve. This idea
might seem like common sense, but too often developers get bogged down in implementing
code without understanding the actual problem, or they’ll modify the code until it works
without fully grasping why.

What if, for example, you fixed a Null Reference Exception with a quick if-null statement at the 
top of a method? Are you sure that was the real culprit, or was the problem a call to another 
method deeper inside?

Instead of adding code to fix a problem, investigate the root cause. Ask yourself why it’s
happening rather than applying a band-aid solution.

---

## Improve incrementally, every day

Making clean code is a fluid, iterative process. Get the whole team into this mindset, and 
expect code cleanup to be part of your day-to-day life as a developer. Most people don’t 
intend to write broken code. It just evolves that way over time. Your codebase needs constant 
maintenance and upkeep, so budget time for that and make sure it happens.

## Make it good, not perfect

On the flip side, don’t strive for perfection. When your code meets production standards, it’s 
time to commit it and move on.

Ultimately, your code needs to do something. Balance implementing new functionality with 
code cleanup. Don’t refactor for the sake of it. Refactor when you think it will provide a benefit 
to you or somebody else.

## Plan, but adapt

In The Pragmatic Programmer, Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas write, “Rather than construction, 
programming is more like gardening.” Software engineering is an organic process, so be 
prepared and adapt for when things don’t go according to plan.

Even if you make the most elaborate drawing, designing a garden on paper will not guarantee 
results. Your plants may bloom differently than you expected. You’ll need to prune, transplant, 
and replace parts of your code to make this garden successful.

Software design isn’t quite like an architect drawing blueprints because it’s more malleable and 
less mechanical. You’ll need to react as your codebase grows.

Once you decide how to tackle a problem, approach similar things the same way. It’s not 
difficult but will take constant effort. Apply this principle to everything from naming (classes 
and methods, casing, etc.) to organizing project folders and resources.

Your project will become messy if left unchecked. It’s a natural consequence of so many 
people working on different parts of a project. Everyone is responsible for pitching in and 
preventing code clutter, and each team member will need to read and follow the style guide.

Above all, have your team agree on a style guide and then follow it.

As Robert C. Martin, an American software engineer and author also known as “Uncle Bob”
says, although keeping code clean and simple is in everyone’s best interest, “clean and simple”
is not the same as “easy.” Clean and simple takes effort and is hard work for beginners and
experienced developers alike.

## Follow a style guide [Image: Im0]

## There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. [Image: Im0]

## – Phil Karlton, software engineer [Image: Im0]

## A style guide for you and your team

This guide focuses on the most common coding conventions you’ll encounter during Unity 
development. These are mostly a subset of the Microsoft Framework Design Guidelines, 
which include an extensive number of rules beyond what is presented here.

to your team’s preferences. Pick a style that suits everyone and ensure they apply it.

Consistency is king. If you follow these suggestions and need to modify your style guide 
in the future, a few find-and-replace operations can migrate your codebase quickly.

---

When your style guide conflicts with this document or the Microsoft Framework Design 
Guidelines, it should take precedence over them because this will allow your team to 
maintain a uniform style throughout your project.

Your application is the collective product of individuals who might think differently from one 
another. A style guide helps rein in those differences to create a cohesive final product. No 
matter how many contributors work on a Unity project, it should feel like it’s been developed 
by a single author.

Style guides take the guesswork out of coding conventions and formatting. Consistent style 
then becomes a matter of following directions.

If you’re a solo developer, this might feel like a constraint at first, but following a style guide is 
essential when working in teams.

Think of a style guide as an initial investment that will pay dividends later. Maintaining a single 
set of standards can reduce the time spent on relearning if you move anyone onto another 
project.

Microsoft and Google both offer comprehensive example guides which are generally 
considered to be the industry standards:

— Microsoft C# Coding Conventions

— C# at Google Style Guide

These are excellent starting points for managing your Unity development and offer solutions 
for naming, formatting, and commenting.

At Unity, we don’t enforce the same code style across all of our beginner tutorials, 
documentation and sample projects. The main reason for doing this is that a strict style guide 
can get in the way of the learning curve for beginner users vs a need to enforce more strict 
guidelines when working in large teams and more advanced use cases. There are simply 
different needs for someone just learning Unity and perhaps their first programming language, 
and engineering teams with 2000+ people.

We created an example C# style sheet that you can also use as a reference as you assemble 
your own guide. Feel free to copy and tweak it as needed.

Let’s dive in.

## Naming conventions [Image: Im0]

There’s a deep psychology involved in giving something a name. A name tells us how that 
entity fits into the world. What is it? Who is it? What can it do for us?

The names of your variables, classes, and methods aren’t mere labels. They carry weight and 
meaning. Good naming style impacts how someone reading your program can comprehend 
the idea you’re trying to convey.

Here are some guidelines to consider for naming.

## Identifier names

An identifier is any name you assign to a type (class, interface, struct, delegate, or enum), 
member, variable, or namespace.

Avoid special characters (backslashes, symbols, Unicode characters) in your identifiers, even 
though C# permits them. These can interfere with certain Unity command-line tools. Steer 
clear of unusual characters to ensure compatibility with most platforms.

---

## Casing terminology

You can’t define variables with spaces in the name because C# uses the space character 
to separate identifiers. Casing schemes can alleviate the problem of using compound 
names or phrases in source code. There are several well-known naming and casing 
conventions.

## Camel case (camelCase)

Also known as camel caps, camel case is the practice of writing phrases without spaces 
or punctuation, separating words with a single capitalized letter. The very first letter is 
lowercase. Local variables and method parameters are camel case. For example:

examplePlayerController

maxHealthPoints

endOfFile

## Pascal case (PascalCase)

Pascal case is a variation of camel case, where the initial letter is capitalized. Use this for 
class, public fields and method names in Unity development. For example:

ExamplePlayerController
MaxHealthPoints
EndOfFile

## Snake case (snake_case)

In this case, spaces between words are replaced with an underscore character. For 
example:

example_player_controller
max_health_points
end_of_file

Max-health-points
end-of-file

example-player-controller
Max-health-points

## Kebab case (kebab-case)

Here, spaces between words are replaced with dashes. The words appear on a “skewer” 
of dash characters. For example:

end-of-file

naming-conventions-methodology

The Kebab-case is widely used in web technologies and namely for CSS. We are also recommending it for use with UI Toolkit USS as we will be covering later in the guide.

---

## Hungarian notation

The variable or function name often indicates its intention or type. For example:

int iCounter

string strPlayerName

Hungarian notation is an older convention and is not common in Unity development.

## Fields and variables

Consider these rules for your variables and fields:

— **Use nouns for variable names: Variable names should be descriptive, clear, and** 
unambiguous because they represent a thing or state. So use a noun when naming them 
except when the variable is of the type bool (see below).

— **Prefix Booleans with a verb: These variables indicate a true or false value. Often** 
they are the answer to a question, such as – is the player running? Is the game over? 
Prefix them with a verb to make their meaning more apparent. Often this is paired with a 
description or condition, e.g. isDead, isWalking, hasDamageMultiplier, etc.

— **Use meaningful names. Don’t abbreviate (unless it’s math): Your variable names should** 
reveal their intent. Choose names that are easy to pronounce and search for – not 
just for your colleagues but also to provide extra context to the code for when using 
AI tools, as this can contribute to more accurate code generation and suggestions. 
Choose identifier names that are easily readable. For example, a property named 
HorizontalAlignment is more readable than AlignmentHorizontal.

Single letter variables are fine for loops and math expressions, but otherwise, don’t 
abbreviate. Clarity is more important than any time saved from omitting a few vowels.

You might be tempted to use short “junk” names when prototyping, but this won’t save 
you time if you need to refactor the code at a later date. Pick meaningful names from the 
beginning.

---

| Examples to avoid | Use instead | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| int d | int elapsedTimeInDays | Avoid single letter abbreviations unless a counter or expression. Be specific about the measurement unit. |
| int hp, string tName,int mvmtSpeed | int healthPoints,string teamName,int movementSpeed | Variable names reveal intent.Make names searchable and pronounceable. |
| int getMovement-Speed | int movementSpeed | Use nouns.Reserve verbs for methods unless it&#x27;s a bool(below). |
| bool dead | bool isDead,bool isPlayerDead | Booleans ask a question that can be answered true or false. |

## — Use pascal case (MyPropertyName) for public fields. Use camel case (myPrivateVariable) for private variables:  For an alternative to public fields, use

**(myPrivateVariable) for private variables:  For an alternative to public fields, use** 
Properties with a public getter (see Formatting below).

— **Consider using prefixes or special encoding: Some guides suggest adding a prefix** 
to private member variables with an underscore (_) to differentiate them from local 
variables. In our style guides we use prefixes for private member variables (m_), 
constants (k_), or static variables (s_), so the name can reveal more about the variable at 
a glance. For example, movementSpeed becomes m_movementSpeed.

Mixing PascalCase with the prefix such as m_MovementSpeed is also an option but is 
generally less commonly used in modern C#.

Alternatively, use the this keyword to distinguish between member and local variables 
in context and skip the prefix. Public fields and properties generally don’t have prefixes. 
Local variables and parameters use camel case with no prefix.

Many developers eschew these and rely on the editor instead. IDEs today support 
highlighting, color coding, and rich context.

— **Fields are automatically initialized to their default values: Default value is typically 0 for** 
numeric types like int, while reference type fields (e.g., objects) are initialized to null by 
default, and bool fields are initialized to false by default. Given this, explicitly setting a 
field to its default value is generally unnecessary.

---

— **Name constant variables with k_ as prefix and in PascalCase: This helps to distinguish** 
constants from regular variables or properties, and makes the code easier to read and 
maintain.

// EXAMPLE: constants
public class MathConstants
{
    public const int k_MaxItems = 100;
}

— **Specify (or omit) access level modifiers consistently: If you leave off the access** 
modifier, the compiler will assume the access level to be private. This works well, but 
be consistent in how you omit the default access modifier.

MSFT guidelines recommended to explicitly specify private to make the access level 
clear and to avoid any ambiguity. Other guides argue you should drop redundant access 
specifiers (leave off ‘private’ at type scope) and, similarly, drop redundant initializers 
(i.e. no ‘= 0’ on the ints, ‘= null’ on ref types, etc.). Remember that you’ll need to use 
protected if you want this in a subclass later. We recommend to leave out things that 
are implicit and thus redundant (such as private) for simplicity if you agree that it doesn’t 
negatively affect readability for you.

— **Favor readability over brevity: As this example from the MSFT documentation shows,** 
the property name CanScrollHorizontally is better than ScrollableX (an obscure reference 
to the X-axis).

## Example code snippets

The code snippets in this guide are non-functional and abbreviated. They’re presented 
here to show style and formatting.

You can also reference this example C# style sheet for Unity developers, which is a 
modified version of Microsoft’s Framework Design Guidelines. This represents just one 
example of how you can set up your team’s style guide.

The specifics of an individual rule are less important than having everyone agree to

// EXAMPLE: public and private variables are grouped together. 
public float DamageMultiplier = 1.5f;
public float MaxHealth;
public bool IsInvincible;
private bool m_isDead;

---

private float m_currentHealth;
public void InflictDamage(float damage, bool isSpecialDamage)
{
    // local variable
    int totalDamage = damage;
    // local variable versus public member variable
    if (isSpecialDamage)
    {
totalDamage *= DamageMultiplier;
    }
    // local variable versus private member variable
    if (totalDamage > _currentHealth)
    {
        /// ...
    }
}

— **Use one variable declaration per line: It’s less compact, but enhances readability.**

— **Avoid redundant names: If your class is called Player, you don’t need to create** 
member variables called PlayerScore or PlayerTarget. Trim them down to Score or 
Target.

— Drop redundant initializers (i.e. no ‘= 0’ on the ints, ‘= null’ on ref types, etc.).

— **Avoid jokes or puns: While they might elicit a chuckle now, the infiniteMonkeys** 
or dudeWheresMyChar variables won’t hold up after a few dozen reads, and more 
importantly, it violates our previous stated goal of naming revealing context.

## — While avoiding ambiguity and always looking for ways to improve readability, you can use var when the type is clear from the context: With good naming ambiguity should be

**use var when the type is clear from the context: With good naming ambiguity should be** 
less of an issue because variable names already convey the intent. Refactoring is simpler 
with var since it abstracts away the specific type, reducing the number of places where 
code needs to be updated when types change. In foreach loops, var ensures that the 
iteration variable matches the type provided by the enumerator. If you explicitly declare 
a mismatched type, the compiler may allow it, leading to runtime errors.

// EXAMPLE: good use of var
var powerUps = new List<PowerUps>();
var dictionary = new Dictionary<string, List<GameObject>>();
// AVOID: potential ambiguity
var powerUps = PowerUpManager.GetPowerUps();

---

## Enums

Enums are special value types defined by a set of named constants. By default, the constants 
are integers, counting up from 0.

Use Pascal case for enum names and values. You can place public enums outside of a class to

a set of possible values. They should have no prefix or suffix.

Note: bitwise enums marked with the System.FlagsAttribute attribute are the exception to 
this rule. You typically pluralize these as they represent more than one type.

// EXAMPLE: enums use singular nouns
public enum WeaponType
{
    Knife,
    Gun,
    RocketLauncher, 
    BFG
}
public enum FireMode
{
    None = 0,
    Single = 5,
    Burst = 7,
    Auto = 8, 
}
// EXAMPLE: but a bitwise enum is plural (you can also use the 1 << bitnum style)
[Flags] 
public enum AttackModes 
{
  // Decimal                          // Binary
   None = 0,                          // 000000
   Melee = 1,                         // 000001
   Ranged = 2,                        // 000010
   Special = 4,                       // 000100
   MeleeAndSpecial = Melee | Special  // 000101
}

---

## Classes and interfaces

Follow these standard rules when naming your classes and interfaces:

— **Use Pascal case nouns or noun phrases for class names: This distinguishes type names** 
from methods, which are named with verb phrases.

— **If you have a Monobehaviour in a file, the source file name must match: You may have** 
other internal classes in the file, but only one Monobehaviour should exist per file.

— **Prefix interface names with a capital I: Follow this with an adjective that describes the** 
functionality.

// EXAMPLE: Class formatting
public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int PublicField;
    public static int MyStaticField;
    private int m_packagePrivate;
    private int m_myPrivate;
    private static int m_myPrivate;
    protected int m_myProtected;
    public void DoSomething()
    {
    }
}
// EXAMPLE: Interfaces
public interface IKillable
{
    void Kill();
}
public interface IDamageable<T>
{
    void Damage(T damageTaken);
}

---

## Methods

In C#, every executed instruction is performed in the context of a method.

**Note: “function” and “method” are often used interchangeably in Unity development.** 
However, because you can’t write a function without incorporating it into a class in C#, 
“method” is the accepted term.

Methods perform actions, so apply these rules to name them accordingly:

— **Start the name with a verb  or verb phrases: Add context if necessary. e.g.** 
GetDirection, FindTarget, etc.

— **Use camel case for parameters: Format parameters passed into the method like local** 
variables.

— **Methods returning bool should ask questions: Much like Boolean variables themselves,** 
prefix methods with a verb if they return a true-false condition This phrases them in the 
form of a question, e.g. IsGameOver, HasStartedTurn.

// EXAMPLE: Methods start with a verb
public void SetInitialPosition(float x, float y, float z)
{
    transform.position = new Vector3(x, y, z);
}
// EXAMPLE: Methods ask a question when they return bool
public bool IsNewPosition(Vector3 currentPosition)
{
    return (transform.position == newPosition);
}

## Events and event handlers

Events in C# implement the observer pattern. This software design pattern defines a
relationship in which one object, the subject (or publisher), can notify a list of dependent
objects called observers (or subscribers). Thus, the subject can broadcast state changes to
its observers without tightly coupling the objects involved. You can learn more about using the
observer and other design patterns in your Unity projects in the e-book Level up your code
with design patterns and SOLID.

Several naming schemes exist for events and their related methods in the subject and 
observers. Try these practices:

— **Name the event with a verb phrase: Choose a name that communicates the state** 
change accurately. Use the present or past participle to indicate events “before” or 
“after.” For example, specify “OpeningDoor” for an event before opening a door or 
“DoorOpened” for an event afterward.

---

— Use the System. Action delegate for events: In most cases, the Action<T> delegate 
can handle the events needed for gameplay. You may pass anywhere from 0 to 16 input 
parameters of different types with a return type of void. Using the predefined delegate 
saves code.

Note: You can also use the EventHandler or EventHandler<TEventArgs> delegates. 
Agree as a team on how everyone will implement events.

// EXAMPLE: Events 
// using System.Action delegate
public event Action OpeningDoor;    // event before
public event Action DoorOpened;     // event after
public event Action<int> PointsScored;
public event Action<CustomEventArgs> ThingHappened;

— **Prefix the event raising method (in the subject) with “On”: The subject that invokes** 
the event typically does so from a method prefixed with “On,” e.g. “OnOpeningDoor” or 
“OnDoorOpened.”

// raises the Event if you have subscribers
public void OnDoorOpened()
{
    DoorOpened?.Invoke();
}
public void OnPointsScored(int points)
{
    PointsScored?.Invoke(points);
}

— **Consider prefixing the event handling method (in the observer) with the subject’s** 
**name and underscore (_): If the subject is named “GameEvents,” your observers can** 
have a method called “GameEvents_OpeningDoor” or “GameEvents_DoorOpened.”

Note that this is called the “event handling method”, not to be confused with the 
EventHandler delegate.

---

— **Create custom EventArgs only as necessary: If you need to pass custom data to your** 
Event, create a new type of EventArgs, either inherited from System.EventArgs or from a 
custom struct.

// define an EventArgs if needed
// EXAMPLE: read-only, custom struct used to pass an ID and Color
public struct CustomEventArgs
{
    public int ObjectID { get; }
    public Color Color { get; }
      public CustomEventArgs(int objectId, Color color)
      {
          this.ObjectID = objectId;
          this.Color = color;
      }
}

## Namespaces

Use namespaces to ensure that your classes, interfaces, enums, etc. won’t conflict with 
existing ones from other namespaces or the global namespace. Namespaces can also prevent 
conflicts with third-party assets from the Asset Store.

When applying namespaces:

— Use PascalCase without special symbols or underscores.

— Add a using directive at the top of the file to avoid repeated typing of the namespace 
prefix.

— Create sub-namespaces as well. Use the dot(.) operator to delimit the name levels, 
allowing you to organize your scripts into hierarchical categories. For example, you can 
create MyApplication.GameFlow, MyApplication.AI, MyApplication.UI, and so on to hold 
different logical components of your game.

— Some prefer to have namespaces that reflect the folder structure of the project as 
having logically grouped related classes and components together, also makes it easier 
to find and understand the structure of the codebase.

---

namespace Enemy 
{
    public class Controller1 : MonoBehaviour 
    {
        ...
    }
    public class Controller2 : MonoBehaviour 
    {
        ...
    }
}

In code, these classes are referred to as Enemy.Controller1 and Enemy.Controller2, 
respectively. Add a using line to save typing out the prefix:

using Enemy;

When the compiler finds the class names Controller1 and Controller2, it understands 
you mean Enemy.Controller1 and Enemy.Controller2.

If the script needs to refer to classes with the same name from different namespaces, 
use the prefix to differentiate them. For instance, if you have a Controller1 and 
Controller2 class in the Player namespace, you can write out  Player.Controller1 and
PlayerController2 to avoid any conflicts. Otherwise, the compiler will report an error.

## Formatting [Image: Im0]

## If you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read. [Image: Im0]

## – Robert C. Martin, author of Clean Code and Agile Software Development [Image: Im0]

The less you think about formatting, the more you can work on something else.

Along with naming, formatting helps reduce guesswork and improves code clarity. By following

Omit, expand, or modify these example rules to fit your team’s needs.

In all cases, consider how your team will implement each formatting rule and then have 
everyone apply it uniformly. Refer back to your team’s style to resolve any discrepancies.

A property provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute class values. Properties 
behave as if they were public member variables, but in fact they’re special methods called 
accessors. Each property has a get and set method to access a private field, called a backing 
field.

In this way, the property encapsulates the data, hiding it from unwanted changes by the user 
or external objects. The getter and setter each have their own access modifier, allowing your 
property to be read-write, read-only, or write-only.

You can also use the accessors to validate or convert the data (e.g., verify that the data fits 
your preferred format or change a value to a particular unit).

The syntax for properties can vary, so your style guide should define how to format them. Use 
these tips to keep properties consistent in your code:

— **Use expression-bodied properties for single line read-only properties (=>): This** 
returns the private backing field.

// EXAMPLE: expression bodied properties
public class PlayerHealth
{
    // the private backing field
    private int m_maxHealth;
    // read-only, returns backing field
    public int MaxHealth => m_maxHealth;
    // equivalent to:
    // public int MaxHealth { get; private set; }
}

— **Everything else uses the older** { get; set; } syntax: If you just want to expose a 
public property without specifying a backing field, use the Auto-Implemented property.

Apply the expression-bodied syntax for the set and get accessors.

Remember to make the setter private if you don’t want to give write access. Align the 
closing with the opening brace for multi-line code blocks.

---

// EXAMPLE: expression bodied properties
public class PlayerHealth
{
    // backing field
    private int m_maxHealth;
    // explicitly implementing getter and setter
    public int MaxHealth
    {
        get => m_maxHealth;
        set => m_maxHealth = value;
    }
    // write-only (not using backing field)
    public int Health { private get; set; }
    // write-only, without an explicit setter
    public SetMaxHealth(int newMaxValue) => _maxHealth = newMaxValue;
}

— While you can also use functions to expose private data as in our example below, it’s 
generally recommended to use properties for simple get/set operations. For operations 
involving complex logic or computation, methods are generally recommended.

// EXAMPLE: expression bodied properties
public class PlayerHealth
{
    // backing field
    private int m_maxHealth;
    public int GetMaxHealth
    {
        return m_maxHealth;
    }
}

## Serialization

Script serialization is the automatic process of transforming data structures or object states 
into a format that Unity can store and reconstruct later. For performance reasons, Unity 
handles serialization differently than in other programming environments.

Serialized fields appear in the Inspector, but you cannot serialize static, constant, or readonly fields. They must be either public or tagged with the [SerializeField] attribute. Unity 
only serializes certain field types, so refer to the documentation page for the complete set of 
serialization rules.

Observe a few basic guidelines when working with serialized fields:

— **Use the [SerializeField] attribute: The SerializeField attribute can work with private** 
or protected variables to make them appear in the Inspector. This encapsulates the 
data better than marking the variable public and prevents an external object from 
overwriting its values.

— **Use the Range attribute to set minimum and maximum values: The [Range(min,** 
max)] attribute is handy if you want to limit what the user can assign to a numeric field. 
It also conveniently represents the field as a slider in the Inspector.

— **Group data in serializable classes or structs to clean up the Inspector: Define a public** 
class or struct and mark it with the [Serializable] attribute. Define public variables 
for each type you want to expose in the Inspector.

// EXAMPLE: a serializable class for PlayerStats
using System;
using UnityEngine;
public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Serializable]
    public struct PlayerStats
    {
        public int MovementSpeed;
        public int HitPoints;
        public bool HasHealthPotion;
    }
// EXAMPLE: The private field is visible in the Inspector
    [SerializeField]
    private PlayerStats m_stats;
}

---

Reference this serializable class from another class. The resulting variables appear within 
collapsible units in the Inspector.

A serializable class or struct can help organize the Inspector.

There are two common indentation styles in C#:

— The K&R style, or “one true brace style,” keeps the opening brace on the same line as 
the previous header.

// EXAMPLE: Allman or BSD style puts opening brace on a new line.
void DisplayMouseCursor(bool showMouse) 
{
     if (!showMouse)
     {
          Cursor.lockState = CursorLockMode.Locked;
          Cursor.visible = false;
     }
     else
     {

---

Cursor.lockState = CursorLockMode.None;
          Cursor.visible = true;
     }
}
// EXAMPLE: K&R style puts opening brace on the previous line.
void DisplayMouseCursor(bool showMouse){
     if (!showMouse) {
          Cursor.lockState = CursorLockMode.Locked;
          Cursor.visible = false;
     }
     else {
          Cursor.lockState = CursorLockMode.None;
          Cursor.visible = true;
     }
}

There are variations on these indentation styles as well. The examples in this guide use the 
Allman style from the Microsoft Framework Design Guidelines. Regardless of which one you 
choose as a team, make sure everyone follows the same indentation and brace style.

Try these tips:

— **Decide on a uniform indentation: This is typically four or two spaces. Get everyone on** 
your team to agree on a setting in your Editor preferences without igniting a tabs versus 
spaces flame war. Note that Visual Studio provides the option to convert tabs to spaces.

---

In Visual Studio (Windows), navigate to Tools > Options > Text Editor > C# > Tabs.

Tabs settings in Visual Studio

On Visual Studio for Mac, navigate to Preferences > Source Code > C# Source Code.
Select the Text Style to adjust the settings.

Convert tabs to spaces to make indentation uniform.

---

— **Where possible, don’t omit braces, even for single-line statements: This increases** 
consistency, keeping your code easier to read and maintain. In this example, the braces 
clearly separate the action, DoSomething, from the loop.

If later you need to add a Debug line or to run DoSomethingElse, the braces will already 
be in place. Some programmers argue that keeping the clause on a separate line allows 
you to add a breakpoint easily.

// EXAMPLE: keep braces for clarity...
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) { DoSomething(i); }
// … and/or keep the clause on a separate line.
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
    DoSomething(i);
}
// AVOID: omitting braces
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) DoSomething(i);

won’t throw an error, but can be confusing. Apply braces for clarity, even if they are
optional. Braces also ensure that modifications, such as adding new logic, can be done
safely without needing to refactor the surrounding structure.

// EXAMPLE: keep braces for clarity
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
     {
ExampleAction();
}
}
// AVOID: removing braces from nested multi-line statements
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
ExampleAction();

---

**Standardize your switch statements: It’s generally advisable to replace longer if-else** 
chains with a switch statement for better readability. Here is one example where you 
indent the case statements. It’s generally recommended to include a default case as well. 
Even if the default case is not needed (for example, in cases where all possibilities are 
covered), including one ensures that the code is prepared to handle unexpected values.

// EXAMPLE: indent cases from the switch statement
switch (someExpression) 
{
   case 0:
      DoSomething();
      break;
   case 1:
      DoSomethingElse();
      break;
   case 2: 
      int n = 1;
      DoAnotherThing(n);
      break;
    default:
      // Handle unexpected or default case
      break;
}

## What is EditorConfig?

Do you have multiple developers working on the same project with different editors and 
IDEs? Consider using an EditorConfig file.

The EditorConfig file can help you define a coding style that works across your entire 
team. Many IDEs, like Visual Studio and Rider, come bundled with native support and do 
not require a separate plugin.

EditorConfig files are easily readable and work with version control systems. You can see

EditorConfig settings take precedence over the global Visual Studio text editor settings.
Your personal editor preferences still apply whenever you’re working in a codebase

See the GitHub repo for some real-world samples.

## Horizontal spacing

Something as simple as spacing can enhance your code’s appearance on-screen. Your personal 
formatting preferences can vary, but try the following suggestions to improve readability:

— **Add spaces to decrease code density: The extra whitespace can give a sense of visual** 
separation between parts of a line improving readability.

// EXAMPLE: add spaces to make lines easier to read
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) { DoSomething(i); }
// AVOID: no spaces
for(inti=0;i<100;i++){DoSomething(i);}

## — Use a single space after a comma between function arguments.

// EXAMPLE: single space after comma between arguments
CollectItem(myObject, 0, 1);
// AVOID: leaving out spacing
CollectItem(myObject,0,1);

## — Don’t add a space after the parenthesis and function arguments.

// EXAMPLE: no space after the parenthesis and function arguments
DropPowerUp(myPrefab, 0, 1);
//AVOID:
DropPowerUp( myPrefab, 0, 1 );

// EXAMPLE: omit spaces inside brackets
x = dataArray[index];
// AVOID
x = dataArray[ index ];

## — Don’t use spaces between a function name and parenthesis.

---

— **Use a single space before flow control conditions: Add a space between the flow** 
comparison operator and the parentheses.

// EXAMPLE: space before condition; separate parentheses with a space.
while (x == y)
// AVOID
while(x==y)

## — Use a single space before and after comparison operators.

// EXAMPLE: space before condition; separate parentheses with a space.
if (x == y)
// AVOID
if (x==y)

— **Keep lines short. Consider horizontal whitespace: Decide on a standard line width (80-**
120 characters). Break a long line into smaller statements rather than letting it overflow.

— **Maintain indentation/hierarchy: Indent your code to increase legibility.**

— **Don’t use column alignment unless needed for readability: This type of spacing aligns** 
the variables but can make it difficult to pair the type with the name.

Column alignment, however, can be useful for bitwise expressions or structs with a lot 
of data. Just be aware that it may create more work for you to maintain the column 
alignment as you add more items. Some auto-formatters might also change which part 
of the column gets aligned.

// EXAMPLE: One space between type and name
    public float Speed = 12f;
    public float Gravity = -10f;
    public float JumpHeight = 2f;
    public Transform GroundCheck;
    public float GroundDistance = 0.4f;
    public LayerMask GroundMask;
// AVOID: column alignment
    public float                Speed = 12f;
    public float                Gravity = -10f;
    public float                JumpHeight = 2f;
    public Transform            GroundCheck;
    public float                GroundDistance = 0.4f;
    public LayerMask            GroundMask;

---

## Vertical spacing

You can use the vertical spacing to your advantage as well. Keep related parts of the script 
together and use blank lines to your advantage. Try these suggestions to organize your code 
from top to bottom:

— **Group dependent and/or similar methods together: Code needs to be logical and** 
coherent. Keep methods that do the same thing next to one another, so someone 
reading your logic doesn’t have to jump around the file.

— **Use the vertical whitespace to your advantage to separate distinct parts of your class:** 
For example, you can add two blank lines between:

— Variable declarations and methods

— Classes and Interfaces

— if-then-else blocks (if it helps readability)

## Regions

The #region directive enables you to collapse and hide sections of code in C# files, making 
large files more manageable and easier to read.

However, if you follow the general advice for Classes from this guide, your class size should 
be manageable and the #region directive superfluous. Break your code into smaller classes 
instead of hiding code blocks behind regions. You will be less inclined to add a region if the 
source file is short.

**Note: Many developers consider regions to be code smells or anti-patterns. Decide as a team** 
on which side of the debate you fall.

## Code formatting in Visual Studio

Don’t despair if these formatting rules seem overwhelming. Modern IDEs make it efficient 
to set up and enforce them. You can create a template of formatting rules and then 
convert your project files at once.

— In Visual Studio (Windows), navigate to Tools > Options. Locate Text Editor > C# >

Use the settings to modify the General, Indentation, New Lines, Spacing, and 
Wrapping options.

---

Code style formatting options

— In Visual Studio for Mac, select Visual Studio > Preferences, then navigate to 
**Source Code > Code Formatting > C# source code.**

Select the Policy at the top. Then set your spacing and indentation in the Text Style 
tab. In the C# Format tab, adjust the Indentation, New Lines, Spacing, and Wrapping 
settings.

The Preview window shows off your style guide choices.

---

If at any time you want to force your script file to conform to the style guide:

— In Visual Studio (Windows), go to Edit > Advanced > Format Document (Ctrl + K, 
**Ctrl + D hotkey chord). If you want only to format white spaces and tab alignment,** 
you can also use Run Code Cleanup (Ctrl + K , Ctrl + E) at the bottom of the editor.

— In Visual Studio for Mac, go to Edit > Format Document (Ctrl + I hotkey)

On Windows, you can also share your editor settings from Tools > Import and Export 
**Settings. Export a file with the style guide’s C# code formatting and then have every** 
team member import that file.

[Image: Im11]

Visual Studio makes it easy to follow the style guide. Formatting then becomes as simple 
as using a hotkey.

---

**Note: You can configure an EditorConfig file (see above) instead of importing and** 
exporting Visual Studio settings. Doing this allows you to share formatting more easily 
across different IDEs, and it has the added benefit of working with version control. See 
the .NET code style rule options for more information.

Though this isn’t specific to clean code, be sure to check out this GDC session, Visual 
Studio tips & tricks to boost your productivity. Clean code is much easier to format and 
refactor if you apply these productivity tips.

To set up an .editorconfig file in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1.	 In the root directory of your project, create a new file named .editorconfig.

2.	 Open the .editorconfig file and add your desired configuration settings. Here’s an example 
configuration for C#:

## Classes [Image: Im0]

## No one in the brief history of computing has ever written a piece of perfect software. It’s unlikely that you’ll be the first. [Image: Im0]

## – Andy Hunt, author of The Pragmatic Programmer [Image: Im0]

## The newspaper metaphor

According to Robert C. Martin’s Clean Code, the first rule of classes is that they should be 
small. The second rule is they should be even smaller than that.

Limiting the size of each class makes it more focused and cohesive. It’s easy to keep
adding on top of an existing class until it overextends with functionality. Instead make a
conscious effort to keep the classes short. Big, bloated classes become difficult to read and

Imagine the source code of a class as a news article. You start reading from the top, where 
the headline and byline catch your eye. The lead-in paragraph gives you a rough summary. 
Then you glean more details as you continue downward.

---

Journalists call this the inverted pyramid. The broad strokes of most newsworthy items appear 
at the beginning. You only get the story’s nuances as you read to the end.

Your class should also follow this basic pattern. Organize top-down and think of your functions 
as forming a hierarchy. Some methods serve a higher-level and lay the groundwork for the big 
picture. Put these first. Then, place lower-level functions with implementation details later.

For example, you might make a method called ThrowBall that references other methods, 
SetInitialVelocity and CalculateTrajectory. Keep ThrowBall first, since that 
describes the main action. Then, add the supporting methods below it.

Though each news article is short, a newspaper or news website will have many such 
collected stories. When taken together, the articles comprise a unified, functional whole. Think 
of your Unity project in the same way. It has numerous classes that must come together to 
form a larger, yet coherent, application.

## Class organization

Each class will need some standardization. Group class members into sections to 
organize them:

— Fields

— Properties

— Events / Delegates

— Monobehaviour Methods (Awake, Start, OnEnable, OnDisable, OnDestroy, etc.)

— Public Methods

— Private Methods

Recall the recommended class naming rules in Unity: the source file name must match the 
name of the Monobehaviour in the file. You might have other internal classes in the file, 
but only one Monobehaviour should exist per file unless separated by namespaces.

---

# Single-responsibility principle

Remember the goal is to keep each class short. In software design, the single-responsibility 
principle guides you toward simplicity.

The idea is that each module, class, or function is responsible for one thing. Suppose you want 
to build a game of Pong. You might start with classes for a paddle, a ball, and a wall.

Fancy a game of Pong?

For example, a Paddle class might need to:

— Store basic data about how fast it can move

— Move the paddle in response

— Check keyboard input

— Play a sound when colliding with a ball

---

Because the game design is simple, you can incorporate all of these things into a basic Paddle 
class. In fact, it’s entirely possible to create one Monobehaviour that does everything you need.

One Monobehaviour doing everything

However, keeping everything as part of one class, even a small one, complicates the design by 
mixing responsibilities. The data intertwines with the input, while the class needs to apply logic 
to both. Contrary to the KISS principle, you’ve taken a few simple things and entangled them.

Instead, break your Paddle class into smaller classes, each with a single responsibility. 
Separate data into its own PaddleData class or use a ScriptableObject. Then refactor 
everything else into a PaddleInput class, a PaddleMovement class, and a PaddleAudio class.

A PaddleLogic class can process the input from the PaddleInput. Applying the speed 
information from the PaddleData, it can shift the paddle using the PaddleMovement. Finally, the 
PaddleLogic can notify the PaddleAudio to play a sound when the ball collides with the paddle.

---

Refactor a Paddle class into single responsibilities

Each class does one thing in this redesign and fits into small, digestible pieces. You don’t need 
to scroll through several screens to follow the code.

You’ll still require a Paddle script but its sole job is to tie these other classes together. The bulk 
of the functionality is split into the other classes.

Note that clean code is not always the most compact code. Even when you use shorter 
classes, the total number of lines may increase during refactoring. However, each individual 
class becomes easier to read. When the time comes to debug or add new features, this 
simplified structure helps keep everything in its place.

## Refactoring example

For a more in-depth look at refactoring a simple project, see How to architect code as 
your project scales. This article demonstrates how to break down larger Monobehaviours 
into smaller pieces using the single-responsibility principle.

You can also watch Mikael Kalms’ original presentation, “From Pong to 15-person project,” 
at Unite Berlin.

## Methods [Image: Im0]

*You know you are working on clean code* 
*when each routine you read turns out to be* 
*pretty much what you expected.*
[Image: Im0]

## – Ward Cunningham, inventor of Wiki and cofounder of eXtreme Programming [Image: Im0]

Try the following suggestions when you create methods for your custom classes:

Like classes, methods should be small with a single responsibility. Each method should 
describe one action or answer one question. It shouldn’t do both.

A good name for a method reflects what it does. For example, GetDistanceToTarget is a
name that clarifies its intended purpose. Some will argue that being even more explicit with
GetDistanceToTargetInMeters to make it clear that the distance is being returned in
meters is also preferable, if your project has multiple units of measurement.

— **Use fewer arguments: Arguments can increase the complexity of your method. Reduce** 
their number to make your methods easier to read and test.

— **Avoid excessive overloading: You can generate an endless permutation of method** 
overloads. Select the few that reflect how you will call the method and implement those.

---

If you do overload a method, prevent confusion by making sure each method signature 
has a distinct number of arguments.

— **Avoid side effects: A method only needs to do what its name advertises. Avoid** 
modifying anything outside of its scope. Pass in arguments by value instead of by 
reference when possible. If sending back results via the out or ref keyword, make sure 
that’s the one thing you intend the method to accomplish.

Though side effects are useful for certain tasks, they can lead to unintended 
consequences. Write a method without side effects to cut down on unexpected behavior.

— **Instead of passing in a flag, make another method: Don’t set up your method to work** 
in two different modes based on a flag. Make two methods with distinct names. For 
example, don’t make a GetAngle method that returns degrees or radians based on a 
flag setting. Instead make methods for GetAngleInDegrees and GetAngleInRadians.

While the Boolean flag as an argument seems innocuous, it can lead to tangled 
implementation or broken single-responsibility.

## Methods vs functions?

In Unity and C#, we refer to methods rather than functions because methods are 
functions that are defined within the context of a class or object. Since C# is an objectoriented programming (OOP) language, everything revolves around classes and objects, 
and methods are the actions that those objects can perform. A function, on the other hand, 
is a more generic term for a block of code that performs a specific task. In procedural 
programming languages, functions can exist independently, but in object-oriented 
languages like C# they are encapsulated within classes and are thus called methods.

## Extension methods

Extension methods offer a way to add additional functionality to classes that might otherwise 
be sealed and can be a clean way to extend the UnityEngine API.

To create an extension method, make a static method and use the this keyword before the 
first argument, which will be the type you want to extend.

For example, suppose you want to make a method called ResetTransformation to remove any 
scaling, rotation, or translation from a GameObject.

---

You can create a static method passing in a Transform for the first argument with the this
keyword:

// EXAMPLE: Define an extension method
public static class TransformExtensions
{
    public static void ResetTransformation(this Transform transform)
    {
        transform.position = Vector3.zero;
        transform.localRotation = Quaternion.identity;
        transform.localScale = Vector3.one;
    }
}

Then, when you want to use it, invoke the ResetTransformation method. The 
ResetOnStart class calls it on the current Transform during Start.

// EXAMPLE: Calling the extension method
public class ResetOnStart : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        transform.ResetTransformation();
    }
}

For organization purposes, define your extension methods in a static class. For example, 
you create a class called TransformExtensions for methods that extend Transforms, 
Vector3Extensions for extending Vector3s, and so on.

Extension methods can build many useful utilities without the need to create more
Monobehaviours. See Unity Learn: Extension Methods to add them to your gamedev bag of

## The DRY principle: Don’t repeat yourself

In The Pragmatic Programmer, Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas formulated the DRY principle, or, 
“don’t repeat yourself.” This oft-spoken mantra in software engineering advises programmers 
to avoid duplicate or repetitious logic.

In doing so, you can ease bug fixing and maintenance costs. If you follow the singleresponsibility principle, you shouldn’t need to change an unrelated piece of code whenever
you modify a class or a method. Quashing a logical bug in a DRY program stops it everywhere.

---

The opposite of DRY is WET (“we enjoy typing” or “write everything twice”). Programming is 
WET when there are unnecessary repetitions in the code.

Imagine there are two ParticleSystems (explosionA and explosionB) and two AudioClips 
(soundA and soundB). Each ParticleSystem needs to play with its respective sound, which you 
can achieve with simple methods like this.

// EXAMPLE: WRITE EVERYTHING TWICE
    private void PlayExplosionA(Vector3 hitPosition)
    {
        explosionA.transform.position = hitPosition;
        explosionA.Stop();
        explosionA.Play();
        AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(soundA, hitPosition);
    }
    private void PlayExplosionB(Vector3 hitPosition)
    {
        explosionB.transform.position = hitPosition;
        explosionB.Stop();
        explosionB.Play();
        AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(soundB, hitPosition);
    }

// EXAMPLE: Refactored DRY version
    private void PlayFXWithSound(ParticleSystem particle, AudioClip 
clip, Vector3 hitPosition)
    {
        particle.transform.position = hitPosition;
        particle.Stop();
        particle.Play();

Here each method takes a Vector3 position to move the ParticleSystem into place for playback. 
First, stop the particles (in case they are already playing) and play the simulation. The 
AudioSource’s static PlayClipAtPoint method then creates a sound effect at the same location.

One method is a cut-and-paste version of the other with a little text replacement. Though this 
works, you need to make a new method – with duplicate logic – every time you want to create 
an explosion.

Instead, refactor it into one PlayFXWithSound method like this:

---

AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(clip, hitPosition);
    }

Add more ParticleSystems and AudioClips and you can continue using this same method to 
play them in concert.

Note that it’s possible to duplicate code without violating the DRY principle. It’s more important 
that you don’t duplicate logic.

Here, we’ve extracted the core functionality into the PlayFXWithSound method. If you 
need to adjust the logic, you only need to change it in one method rather than in both 
PlayExplosionA and PlayExplosionB.

# Comments

## Code is like humor. If you have to explain it, it’s bad.

### – Cory House, software architect and author

Well-placed comments enhance the readability of your code. Excessive or frivolous comments can have the opposite effect. Like all things, strike a balance when using them. Most of your code won’t need comments if you follow KISS principles and break your code into easy-to-digest logical parts. Well-named variables and functions will explain themselves. Rather than answering “what,” useful comments fill in the gaps and tell you “why.” Did you make specific decisions that are not immediately obvious? Is there a tricky bit of logic that needs clarification? Useful comments reveal information not gleaned from the code itself. Here are some dos and don’ts for comments: — **Don’t add comments to replace bad code: If you need to add a comment to explain a** convoluted tangle of logic, restructure your code to be more obvious. Then you won’t need the comment. © 2025 Unity Technologies **48 of 64 | unity.com**

---

— **A properly named class, variable, or method serves in place of a comment: Is the code** 
self-explanatory? Then reduce noise and skip the comment.

// AVOID: noisy, redundant comments
// the target to shoot
Transform targetToShoot;

— **Place the comment on a separate line when possible, not at the end of a line of code:**
In most cases, keep each one on its own line for clarity.

— **Use the double slash (//) comment tag in most situations: Keep the comment near** 
the code that it explains rather than using a large multi-line at the beginning. Keeping it 
close helps the reader connect the explanation with the logic.

— **Use a tooltip instead of a comment for serialized fields: If your fields in the Inspector** 
need explanation, add a tooltip attribute and skip the separate comment. The tooltip will 
do double duty.

// EXAMPLE: Tooltip replaces comment
[Tooltip(“The amount of side-to-side friction.”)]
public float Grip;

Tooltip in the Inspector

---

— **You can also use a summary XML tag in front of public methods or functions: Visual** 
Studio can provide IntelliSense for many common XML-style comments.

// EXAMPLES:
// This is a common comment.
// Use them to show intent, logical flow, and approach.
// You can also use a summary XML tag.
//
/// <summary>
/// Controls the weapon system including firing, reloading, and dealing 
damage
/// </summary>
public void Fire()
{
    ...
}

## — Insert one space between the comment delimiter (//) and the comment text.

— **Add legal disclaimers: A comment is appropriate for the license or copyright information.** 
However, avoid inserting an entire legal brief into your code. Link instead to an external 
page with the full legal information.

— **Style your comments: Maintain a uniform appearance for your comments, e.g., begin** 
each comment with an uppercase letter and end with a period. Whatever your team 
decides, make it part of the style guide and follow it.

— **Don’t create formatted blocks of asterisks or special characters around comments:** 
This reduces readability and contributes to the general malaise of code clutter.

— **Remove commented out code: Though commenting out statements may be normal** 
during testing and development, don’t leave commented code lying around. Rely on your 
source control for previous versions of the code. Then have the courage to delete those 
two lines of code.

— **Keep your TODO comments up-to-date: As you complete tasks, make sure you scrub the** 
TODO comments you’ve left as a reminder. Outdated comments are distractions.

— **Avoid attributions: You don’t need to add bylines, e.g., // added by devA** or devB.
Let the source control system take care of that.

You can add a name and date to a TODO for more accountability and context.

# UI Toolkit naming conventions

## If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be

## the process of putting them in.

### — Edsger W. Dijkstra, computer science pioneer

While our guide so far has focused on C# code style, we also want to touch upon naming conventions for using UI Toolkit and working with UXML and CSS. With UI Toolkit you’ll need to query the visual elements and Unity Style Sheets (USS) using a string identifier, so using a defined set of standards will lead overall to fewer errors and more readable code. We generally recommend the Block Element Modifier (BEM) naming convention for your visual elements in the UXML and Style Sheets classes. BEM is widely used in the context of CSS and modern web development that is the inspiration for UI Toolkit. At a glance, an element’s BEM-style name can tell you what it does, where it appears, and how it relates to other elements around it. BEM uses three main components in the following convention: block-name__element-name--modifier-name

---

Here’s an example:

navbar-menu__shop-button--small

Each name part may consist of Latin letters, digits, and dashes. Also note that each name part 
is joined together with either a double underscore __ or a double dash --.

The block name (block-name) represents a high level-compontent, like a navigation menu 
or character stats – a distinct and meaningful UI component in your layout. In the case of a 
generic button that is not specific to any particular block, that can simply be left out, e.g., 
button--small.

The element element-name is a child or part of a block and therefore, semantically tied to its 
block. In other words, elements rely on the block for their context and cannot exist without it. 
So, in the case of the shop-button example, its style indicates that it’s different from other 
buttons belonging to the navbar-menu block (e.g., shop-button in navbar-menu__shopbutton).

If your new element instantiates child elements in its constructor, assign the relevant classes 
to the children. For example, my-block__first-child, my-block__other-child.

Finally, the modifier indicates a variation or state of a block or element. That could be when 
a button is pressed, a textbox item is selected and highlighted or in our example when it’s a 
small variant of the shop button. This makes it easy to adapt to different scenarios without 
duplicating code.

Here are some more examples of BEM naming:

— menu__home-button

— navbar-menu__shop-button--small

BEM class names are self-descriptive, making it easier for developers to understand the 
structure and purpose of components and making a clear hierarchy helps manage and update 
styles as projects grow.

These examples use hyphen delimiting (aka Kebab case), which is common for CSS naming.
Like with our other general guidelines, teams can decide which naming scheme works best for
them, but should aim to choose early in the project and stay consistent later on.

Read more about CSS naming conventions in this article, as well as in the UI Toolkit 
documentation.

## Tips for naming conventions in UI Toolkit

Here are some guidelines for effective naming:

— Keep names short and clear (unambiguous). It’s important to ensure that names are 
concise yet descriptive enough to convey their purpose and role within the UI.

— Avoid using type names (Button, Label) or element names (#my-button) in your 
BEM selectors. This avoids redundancy and potential confusion. BEM names should 
represent their roles and states, not their types.

— Avoid names/modifiers that can change (e.g., use “button–quit” instead of “button–
red” when the color scheme is not yet final). Use semantic naming rather than 
presentational naming, which ensures names remain relevant even if styling details 
change.

— Extend these conventions to art assets, like sprites and textures associated with the 
UI Toolkit interface. Consistency in naming between code and assets helps maintain 
a clear relationship and better organization throughout the project.

— If you use the element in other projects, consider prefixing your classes to avoid 
conflicts with existing user class names. Namespacing or prefixing can prevent 
clashes when integrating with other projects or libraries.

— Use AddToClassList() in the constructor to add the relevant USS classes to your 
element instances. This method ensures that the appropriate styles are applied 
by adding the necessary classes at the time of element instantiation, maintaining 
consistency and clarity in your UI code.

## Common pitfalls [Image: Im0]

Clean code isn’t an accident. It’s the deliberate work of individuals trying to think and code like 
a team.

Not everything goes to plan, of course. Unclean code inevitably happens, no matter how hard 
you might try. You’ll need to be on the hunt for it.

A code smell is a telltale sign you might have troublesome code lurking in the project. Though 
the following symptoms don’t necessarily point to underlying problems, they are worth 
investigating when they appear:

— **Enigmatic naming: Everyone loves a good mystery, except in their coding standards.** 
Classes, methods, and variables need straightforward, no-nonsense names. See the 
naming section for more information.

— Needless complexity: Over-engineering happens when you try to anticipate every
possible need for a class. This can manifest itself as a God object with long methods
or large classes that try to do too much. Break up a large monolithic class into smaller
dedicated parts, each with its own responsibility.

— **Inflexibility: A small change should not require you to make multiple changes elsewhere.** 
Double-check that you aren’t breaking the single-responsibility principle if that’s the case.

When you give something more than one responsibility, it breaks more easily because it’s 
harder to anticipate everything. If you update a method that is doing one thing, and the 
updated logic still works, you expect the rest of your code to continue to work afterward.

---

— **Fragility: If you make a minor change and everything stops working, this often indicates** 
a problem.

— **Immobility: You’ll often write code that is reusable in a different context. If it requires** 
many dependencies to deploy elsewhere, then decouple how the logic works.

— **Duplicate code: If it’s noticeable that you’ve cut and pasted code, it’s time to refactor.** 
Extract the core logic into its own function and call that from the other functions. Copyand-paste code is difficult to maintain because you need to update the logic in multiple 
locations each time there is a change. See the section on DRY principles for more 
information.

— **Excessive commentary: Comments can help explain code that isn’t intuitive. However,** 
developers can overuse them. A running commentary for every variable or statement is 
unnecessary. It’s better to have a well-named method or class where the name reveals 
the intent and no comment is needed. If you split your logic into smaller pieces, the 
shorter code snippets require less explanation.

## Conclusion [Image: Im0]

## Programming is not a zero-sum game. Teaching something to a fellow programmer doesn’t take it away from you. [Image: Im0]

## – John Carmack, cofounder of id Software [Image: Im0]

We hope you enjoyed this introduction to the principles of clean coding and code style guides.

The techniques presented here are less a specific set of rules than a set of habits, and like all 
habits, you’ll need to discover them yourself through daily application.

As mentioned earlier in the guide, feel free to copy this C# style sheet for Unity developers to
use as a starting point for your own guide. Make the tweaks as needed, depending on your
preferences. The most important thing is you agree on a standard as a team and stick to that.

However, it doesn’t stop with styling conventions. Prepare your code to be scalable by breaking 
it into small, modular pieces. As the marathon of development unfolds, expect to rewrite your 
code over and over again. Production can be a trying process with changing requirements.

## Appendix: Script templates [Image: Im0]

# Talk is cheap. Show me the code. [Image: Im0]

Script templates are predefined code snippets  that are used when generating new C# files 
like monobehaviour or Scriptable Objects in Unity (e.g., via Assets > Create > C# Script).

## — Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux and Git [Image: Im0]

Once you establish formatting rules for your style guide, you can thus configure your script 
templates to help ensure consistency to your guidelines in your codebase and help reduce 
some repetitive work.

The files can be found here:

## Windows: C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\[UnityVersion]\Editor\Data\Resources\ScriptTemplates

/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/[UnityVersion]/Unity.app/Contents/Resources/ScriptTemplates

---

On macOS, reveal the Unity.app package contents to show the Resources subdirectory.

Inside this path, you’ll see the default templates such as:

1-Scripting__MonoBehaviour Script-NewMonoBehaviourScript.cs.txt

2-Scripting__ScriptableObject Script-NewScriptableObjectScript.cs.txt

Whenever you make a new scripted asset in the Project window from the Create menu, Unity 
uses one of these templates.

---

If you open the file named 1-Scripting__MonoBehaviour Script-
NewMonoBehaviourScript.cs.txt with a text editor, you will see the following:

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
public class #SCRIPTNAME# : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        #NOTRIM#
    }
    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        #NOTRIM#
    }
}

## Note the keywords:

— **#SCRIPTNAME#: This is the name you’ve specified for the script. If you don’t customize** 
the name, it uses the default name, e.g., NewBehaviourScript.

— **#NOTRIM#: This guarantees whitespace, making sure one line appears between the** 
curly braces.

Script templates are customizable. For example, you can add a namespace or remove the 
default Update method. Modifying the template can save you a few keystrokes every time you 
create one of these scripted assets.

The script template filename follows this pattern:

— **MenuPath allows you to customize how the file appears in the Create menu. You can** 
create categories with the double underscore(__).

A dash (-) character separates the different parts of the name:

numbers have higher priority.

## PriorityNumber–MenuPath–DefaultName. FileExtension. txt

For example, “CustomScript__Misc__ScriptableObject” creates the menu item 
ScriptableObject under the Create > CustomScript > Misc menu.

---

— **DefaultName is the default name given to the asset if you don’t specify one.**

— **FileExtension is the file extension appended to the asset name.**

Also, note that each script template also has a .txt appended to the FileExtension.

If you want to apply a script template to a specific Unity project, copy and paste the entire 
ScriptTemplates folder directly under the project’s Assets:  /Assets/ScriptTemplates. Or, you 
can copy just the sections that you’re editing, if you prefer.

Next, create new script templates or modify the originals to fit your preferences. Delete any 
script templates from the project if you don’t plan on changing them. You can also just copy 
the files you like to use.

You can also change the original script templates in the application resources but exercise 
caution. That affects all projects using that version of Unity.

See this support article for more information about customizing your script templates. Also, 
check the attached project for a few additional script template examples.

# Appendix: Testing and debugging

## Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you are also the

## murderer.

### — Filipe Fortes

Automated testing is an effective tool for improving the quality of your code and reducing the time spent on bug fixes. Test-driven development (TDD) is a development methodology where you create unit tests while you develop the software. In fact, you’ll routinely write each test case before making a specific feature function.

As you develop the software, you’ll repeatedly run it against this whole test suite of automated processes. This is in stark contrast to writing the software first and building the test cases later. In TDD, coding, testing, and refactoring are interwoven.

---

Here’s the basic idea, presented in Kent Beck’s Test-Driven Development by Example:

**1.	 Add a single unit test: This describes one new feature you want to add to your** 
application; spec out what needs to be done, either from your team or your user base.

**2.	 Run the test: The test should fail since you haven’t implemented the new feature into** 
your program. Additionally, this verifies whether or not the test itself is valid. It should not 
always pass by default.

**3.	 Write the simplest code that passes the new test: Write just enough logic to make** 
it pass the new unit test. This doesn’t have to be clean code at this point. It can use 
inelegant structure, hard-coded magic numbers, and so on, as long as it passes the unit 
test.

**4.	 Confirm that all tests pass: Run the full automated test suite. Your previous unit** 
tests should all pass. The new code meets your new testing requirements and the old 
requirements as well.

If not, modify your new code – and only your new code – until all tests pass.

**5.	 Refactor: Go back and clean up your new code. Use your style guide and make sure** 
everything conforms.

Move the code, so it is logically organized. Keep similar classes and methods together, 
etc. Remove duplicate code, and rename any identifiers to minimize the need for 
comments. Split methods or classes that are too long.

Run the automated testing suite after each refactor.

**6.	 Repeat: Go through this process every time you add a new feature. Each step is a small,** 
incremental change. Make frequent commits under source control. When debugging, you 
only have to examine a small amount of new code for each unit test. This simplifies the 
scope of your work. If all else fails, roll back to the previous commit and begin again.

That’s the gist of it. If you develop software using this methodology, you tend to follow the 
KISS principle by necessity. Add one feature at a time, testing as you go. Refactor continuously 
with each test, so cleaning your code becomes a constant ritual.

Like most of the tenets of clean code, TDD takes extra work in the short-term but often results 
in the improvement of long-term maintenance and readability.

Mode) and on target platforms (e.g., Standalone, Android, iOS). Install UTF via the Package
Manager. The documentation will help you get started.

The general workflow of the Unity Test Framework is to:

— **Create a new test suite, called a Test Assembly: The Test Runner UI simplifies this** 
process and creates a folder in your project.

— **Create a test: The Test Runner UI helps you manage the C# scripts that you will create** 
as unit tests. Select a Test Assembly folder and navigate to Assets > Create > Testing > 
**C# Test Script. Edit this script and add logic for your test.**

— **Run a test: Use the Test Runner UI to run all of the unit tests or run a selected one. Using** 
JetBrains Rider, you can also run UTF directly from the script editor.

— **Add Play mode tests in the Editor or as standalone: The default Test Assembly works** 
in Edit Mode. If you want unit tests to work at runtime, create a separate assembly in 
Play Mode. Configure this for your standalone build as well (with the results of the test 
displayed in the Editor).
